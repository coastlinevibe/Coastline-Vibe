- On successful completion, the business profile is created/updated in the database.

---

### **5. Unified Dashboard Experience**

- User can edit their profile, manage listings, view analytics, etc., all from within the dashboard.

---

### **6. No Separate Flows**
- There is **no separate onboarding page** for business profile setup—everything is managed within the dashboard.
- The dashboard always provides access to the profile setup/edit form under “Listings.”

---

## **Summary**
- **Create Account → Role Assignment → Business Profile Check → Profile Setup (if needed) → Unified Dashboard**
- This matches your requirements for a seamless, in-dashboard business management experience.
