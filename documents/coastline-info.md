## ‚úÖ Already Completed (As of Start)
- Next.js project initialized with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, App Router, src directory, and @/* import alias.
- Shadcn/UI initialized.
- Core dependencies installed (Supabase client, Lucide icons, React Hook Form, Zod, date-fns, React Map GL & Mapbox GL, OpenAI SDK).
- Initial landing page (`src/app/page.tsx`) designed with a header, hero section (including background video), "About Us" section (with decorative images and stats), "Communities to Join" section, and a features highlight section.
- Basic login page (`src/app/login/page.tsx`) created with username and 6-digit PIN fields.
- Header "Login" button now links to the login page.
- Basic signup page (`src/app/signup/page.tsx`) created with email, username, password, community selection, role selection (User/Business), and optional avatar upload fields.
- Supabase client configured in `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` using environment variables from `.env.local`.
- `profiles` table created in Supabase with columns for id, created_at, updated_at, username, email, avatar_url, role, is_approved, and community_id. Triggers for `updated_at` and default `is_approved` (based on role) are set up. RLS is enabled.
- Client-side validation added to the signup form using React Hook Form's built-in validation (previously Zod, changed due to resolver issues).

CoastlineVibe is a local-first coastal community app that empowers residents, visitors, businesses, and property seekers with a powerful all-in-one ecosystem. It includes a Community Feed (polls, posts), a Marketplace (smart buy/sell tools), Properties (map-based search, lifestyle tags), and a Local Directory (dashboard, AI tools for businesses). 

## Role Managemenet
The CoastlineVibe platform uses the following three user roles:

üë§ user
Regular community member

Uses the feed, views properties, browses the market, and directory

Gets access to a dashboard to manage business listings, bookings, promotions, and analytics

üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è superadmin
