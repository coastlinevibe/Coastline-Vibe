Do only what I explicitly ask.

Run databse MCP — always.

Never add features, fields, logic, styles, libraries, or structure unless requested.

If unsure, ask. Never assume or guess.

Do not auto-generate success/error messages, toasts, or redirects.

Use only:

React

Tailwind CSS (basic only) — no animations or UI libraries

Supabase (only auth and queries I approve)

React Hook Form and Zod (only when I request validation)

🧾 Form Rules
Use only the fields I specify.

No helper messages, extra spacing, placeholders, or tooltips unless requested.

Just basic inputs, layout, and a submit button.

Use Zod + React Hook Form only if I say so.

🔐 Supabase Rules
Use only the auth or queries I ask for.

Never use .from('users'), .from('profiles'), or access other tables unless I tell you.

Never assume schema — ask first.

🧩 Project Section Awareness
This project has 4 sections:

Feed

Properties

Coastline Market

Local Directory

Always check whether a change in one section could affect the others.

If there's any cross-section dependency, stop and ask before continuing.

🧠 Cursor Memory Rules
If memory is enabled, it must only store facts I approve.

Do not recall or reuse suggestions, components, or patterns from older unrelated sessions.

If Cursor memory starts generating unapproved behavior:
→ Reset or clear memory immediately.

No remembering of assumed database schemas, form structures, or logic.

Cursor should always ask before making use of anything it's remembering.

❌ Absolutely Do Not
Add unused or helper logic (e.g. formatting functions, hooks).

Use UI libraries, animations, Framer Motion, or third-party components.

Add mock APIs, dummy data, or extra layouts.

Try to "help" or "optimize" anything unless I say so.

Guess field names, relationships, or routes.


Assume a feature should exist because it's common — I define what exists.
