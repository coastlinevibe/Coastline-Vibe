Absolutely. Let’s reframe the **Vibe Circles** subgroup system with playful coastal naval flair — captains, crews, lieutenants, and all the salty swagger of a seaside crew hub. This rewrite will keep all your WOW features but tell the story in the **CoastlineVibe language**.

# ⚓️ **Vibe Circles** – Coastal Command Chat Groups for the CoastlineVibe Fleet

*“Where every Circle is a ship, every chat a voyage, and every member part of the crew.”*

---

## 🌴 **Core Concept**

No mini feeds. No spam seas. Just **high-spirited private chat ships** inside your community port — loaded with real-time voice, media, stickers, reactions, and local slang. Every Circle is captained, crewed, and filled with shared treasure.
